### Questions -
###### Q1. What does it mean when Bootstrap is described as a mobile-first framework?

=> Mobile-first means that Bootstrap designs start with styles for small screens and then add enhancements for larger screens using media queries. The purpose is to ensure good performance and usability on mobile devices first. In practice, developers write base styles that work on phones before adjusting layouts for tablets and desktops. The risk is that ignoring this approach can lead to layouts that break on small devices or feel cramped and unusable.

###### Q2. Why does Bootstrap emphasize conventions over configuration?

=> Conventions over configuration means Bootstrap provides sensible defaults so developers can build interfaces without making many setup choices. The purpose is to reduce decision fatigue and speed up development. In real projects, this allows teams to share a common styling language quickly. The risk is that relying blindly on defaults may produce generic designs that do not match brand identity.

###### Q3. How does progressive enhancement shape Bootstrap’s design philosophy?

=> Progressive enhancement means building a basic, functional experience first, then adding advanced features for capable browsers. The purpose is to maximize accessibility and reliability. In practice, simple layouts work everywhere while JavaScript enhances interactions where supported. The risk is assuming all users have modern browsers, which can break core functionality for some users.

###### Q4. Why is consistency a central goal of Bootstrap?

=> Consistency means using uniform styles and components across an interface. The purpose is to create predictable user experiences and reduce design errors. In real use, buttons, forms, and layouts behave the same throughout a site. The risk is inconsistency if developers override styles randomly, confusing users and increasing maintenance effort.

###### Q5. How does rapid prototyping fit into Bootstrap’s philosophy?

=> Rapid prototyping means quickly building usable interfaces using ready-made components. The purpose is to validate ideas and layouts without starting from scratch. In practice, teams assemble pages using predefined classes and components. The risk is mistaking prototypes for final products and shipping unrefined designs to production.

---
###### Q1. For what types of projects is Bootstrap most suitable?

=> Bootstrap is suitable for projects that need fast, responsive layouts such as dashboards, admin panels, and prototypes. The purpose is to provide a reliable starting point for common UI needs. In practice, teams use it to save time on basic styling. The risk is using it for highly artistic designs where heavy customization becomes costly.

###### Q2. Why is Bootstrap often chosen for MVP development?

###### Q2. What role do Sass partials play in Bootstrap?

=> Sass partials split styles into small, focused files. The purpose is modularity and reuse. In practice, teams import only needed components. The risk is importing everything and losing build efficiency.

###### Q3. How does the dist folder fit into Bootstrap architecture?

=> The dist folder contains compiled CSS and JS for direct use. The purpose is easy distribution. In practice, it is used for CDN or quick setups. The risk is assuming it is meant for customization.

###### Q4. How is JavaScript structured in Bootstrap?

=> Bootstrap JS is organized into plugins for each component. The purpose is modular behavior. In practice, teams import only required plugins. The risk is loading unused scripts and hurting performance.

###### Q5. What architectural idea underlies Bootstrap’s structure?

=> The idea is layered separation of source and distribution. The purpose is flexibility in builds. In practice, it supports both quick use and custom pipelines. The risk is misunderstanding layers and modifying the wrong level.

---
###### Q1. What are customization entry points in Bootstrap?

=> Entry points are places where developers override variables and imports before compiling. The purpose is safe customization. In practice, Sass variables are changed first. The risk is overriding styles after compilation and causing conflicts.

###### Q2. Why are Sass variables preferred for customization?

=> Sass variables control colors, spacing, and typography globally. The purpose is consistent theming. In practice, changing one variable updates many components. The risk is random overrides that break consistency.

###### Q3. How do mixins help in customization?

=> Mixins generate reusable style patterns. The purpose is to apply Bootstrap logic in custom code. In practice, developers reuse grid or utility logic. The risk is copying CSS instead of using mixins, losing maintainability.

###### Q4. What happens if developers customize compiled CSS directly?

=> Direct edits change output files after build. The purpose is quick fixes, but it is discouraged. In practice, changes are lost on updates. The risk is fragile customization that cannot be reproduced.

###### Q5. How should customization be organized in projects?

=> Customization should live in separate Sass files importing Bootstrap. The purpose is clean separation. In practice, teams maintain a custom build file. The risk is mixing framework and custom code, making upgrades hard.

---

###### Q1. What does browser support mean in Bootstrap?

=> Browser support defines which browsers Bootstrap officially targets. The purpose is predictable behavior across environments. In practice, teams check supported lists before using features. The risk is relying on features unsupported by target users.

###### Q2. Why are polyfills sometimes needed?
