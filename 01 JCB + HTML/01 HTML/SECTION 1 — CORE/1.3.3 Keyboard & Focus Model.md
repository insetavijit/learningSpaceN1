Boss, here is **[[1.3.3 Keyboard & Focus Model]]** in the **same structure**, concise and quality-focused.

## **[[1.3.3 Keyboard & Focus Model]]**

### **Objective**

Build a precise mental and practical model of how keyboard navigation and focus behavior determine whether web interfaces are operable without a mouse.

### **Approach**

Treat focus as both a **technical state (active element in the DOM)** and a **user navigation cue (where interaction occurs next)**. Study it from the dual perspective of **browser defaults** and **author-controlled focus management**.

### **Method**

- Study default **tab order** based on DOM sequence and native focusability.
    
- Identify which elements are focusable by default and how `tabindex="0"` and `tabindex="-1"` modify focus behavior.
    
- Practice **focus management** in dynamic interfaces by moving focus after actions such as opening dialogs or submitting forms.
    
- Test **sequential navigation** using Tab and Shift+Tab to ensure predictable forward and backward movement.
    
- Observe activation keys (Enter, Space) on links, buttons, and custom controls.
    
- Verify visible focus indicators and ensure they remain perceivable.
    
- Inspect `document.activeElement` and DevTools focus overlays during interaction.
    
- Simulate keyboard-only usage across complete interaction flows.
    

### **Constraints**

- Do not remove focus outlines without providing a visible alternative.
    
- Avoid positive `tabindex` values that disrupt natural order.
    
- Never trap focus without a clear and accessible escape mechanism.
    
- Do not make non-interactive elements focusable unless they implement full interaction behavior.
    
- Ensure focus always moves to meaningful, operable elements.
    
- Avoid unexpected focus jumps that disorient users.

Boss, here is the **topic → brief description table** for **[[1.3.3 Keyboard & Focus Model]]**, matching the structure and precision of your previous sections.

|**Topic**|**Brief Description**|
|---|---|
|**Tab order**|The sequence in which focus moves when users press the Tab key, determined by DOM order, `tabindex` values, and element focusability, forming the backbone of keyboard navigation.|
|**Focus management**|The deliberate control of where focus is placed during dynamic UI changes (e.g., modals, menus, validation errors) to maintain context and prevent disorientation for keyboard and screen reader users.|
|**Sequential navigation**|The principle of enabling users to traverse interactive elements in a logical, predictable order using only the keyboard, ensuring full operability without a pointing device.|

Certainly, Boss. Below is the **HTML technical interview question set** for:

> **[[1.3.3 Keyboard & Focus Model]]**  
> Tab order, focus management, and sequential navigation.

Structured for **Beginner → Advanced → Professional (Interview)** rounds.

---

## **Beginner Level — 3 Questions**

1. What is _tab order_, and how does it affect keyboard navigation on a webpage?
    
2. Which HTML elements are focusable by default, and why?
    
3. What happens when a user presses the **Tab** key on a standard form or page?
    

---

## **Advanced Level — 4 Questions**

1. How does the `tabindex` attribute influence focus order and focusability? Explain the difference between `0`, positive values, and `-1`.
    
2. What is focus management, and why is it important in dynamic interfaces like modals or dropdowns?
    
3. How does sequential navigation differ from spatial navigation, and how does HTML primarily support it?
    
4. What common mistakes break logical tab order, even when semantic HTML is used?
    

---

## **Professional / Interview Level — 5 Questions**

1. Design a focus strategy for a modal dialog: where should focus move when it opens, how should it be trapped, and where should it return on close?
    
2. How would you debug a production issue where keyboard users cannot reach a critical control due to broken tab order?
    
3. In large applications with dynamically injected content, how do you ensure predictable and accessible sequential navigation?
    
4. What are the long-term maintenance risks of using positive `tabindex` values, and what alternatives do you recommend?
    
5. How would you test and validate keyboard and focus behavior across browsers and assistive technologies in an enterprise environment?
