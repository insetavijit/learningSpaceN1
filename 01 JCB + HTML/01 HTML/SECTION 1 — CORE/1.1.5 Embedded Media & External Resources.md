### **Objective**

Build a precise mental and practical model of how embedded media and external resources integrate into web documents, and how they affect **content meaning, accessibility, performance, and user experience** across devices and network conditions.

### **Approach**

Treat media elements as both **content carriers (what users consume)** and **resource loaders (what browsers fetch and manage)**. Study them from the dual perspective of **semantic representation** and **rendering/performance behavior** in the browser.

### **Method**

- Start with the anatomy of `<img>`, `<audio>`, `<video>`, and `<iframe>`:  
    `src`, `alt`, `controls`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `muted`, `loading`, `width/height`.
    
- Practice embedding images with proper `alt` text and intrinsic dimensions to avoid layout shifts.
    
- Implement **responsive images** using `<picture>`, `srcset`, and `sizes` for different viewports and resolutions.
    
- Add audio and video with native controls and multiple `<source>` formats for compatibility.
    
- Experiment with `preload`, `poster`, and `muted autoplay` policies to observe browser behavior.
    
- Embed third-party content using `<iframe>` and inspect sandboxing, permissions, and lazy loading.
    
- Use `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to semantically bind media with explanatory text.
    
- Inspect network requests, media decoding, and layout shifts in DevTools.

### **Constraints**

- Always provide meaningful `alt` text for informative images (use empty `alt=""` only for decorative ones).
    
- Avoid media autoplay with sound; respect user control and browser policies.
    
- Do not embed heavy iframes or videos without lazy loading or user intent.
    
- Never use images or media purely for layout (use CSS instead).
    
- Provide captions or transcripts for audio/video when content is informational.
    
- Avoid deprecated `<object>`/`<embed>` unless absolutely required for legacy formats.
    
- Respect aspect ratios and define dimensions to prevent CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift).

|**Topic**|**Brief Description**|
|---|---|
|**Images (`<img>`)**|The primary element for embedding raster or vector images into a page, using `src` and `alt` to deliver visual content while supporting accessibility, SEO, and responsive layout behavior.|
|**Responsive images (`<picture>`, `srcset`, `sizes`)**|Techniques and elements that allow the browser to choose the most appropriate image resource based on device resolution, viewport size, and media conditions, optimizing performance and clarity.|
|**Audio content (`<audio>`)**|Embeds sound files directly in the document with native playback controls, enabling background audio, podcasts, or alerts without external plugins.|
|**Video content (`<video>`)**|Integrates video media with built-in controls, captions, and multiple source formats, supporting rich multimedia experiences across modern browsers.|
|**Inline frames (`<iframe>`)**|Embeds an external HTML document within the current page, commonly used for maps, videos, widgets, or third-party integrations while maintaining isolation from the parent document.|
|**Embedded objects (`<object>`, `<embed>`)**|Generic containers for external resources such as PDFs or legacy media, providing fallback content and broader embedding capabilities beyond images, audio, and video.|
|**Figures and captions (`<figure>`, `<figcaption>`)**|Semantic grouping elements that associate media or illustrative content with descriptive captions, improving meaning, accessibility, and content comprehension.|

## **Beginner Level — 3 Questions**

1. What is the purpose of the `<img>` tag, and which attributes are essential for displaying an image correctly in HTML?
    
2. How do you embed audio and video in an HTML page using the `<audio>` and `<video>` elements?
    
3. What is an `<iframe>`, and when would you use it to include external content on a webpage?
    

## **Advanced Level — 4 Questions**

1. Explain how responsive images work using `<picture>`, `srcset`, and `sizes`. Why are they important for performance?
    
2. What is the difference between `<figure>` and a generic `<div>` when wrapping media content?
    
3. How do browser controls, autoplay, loop, and muted attributes affect `<audio>` and `<video>` elements?
    
4. Compare `<iframe>` with embedding media directly using `<video>` or `<img>`. What are the trade-offs?
    

## **Professional / Interview Level — 5 Questions**

1. How would you optimize images for a high-traffic, mobile-first website using modern HTML features and formats while preserving visual quality?
    
2. What security and performance concerns are associated with `<iframe>` usage, and how do attributes like `sandbox`, `allow`, and `referrerpolicy` mitigate them?
    
3. In a production environment, how do you ensure accessibility for audio and video content, including captions, transcripts, and keyboard controls?
    
4. When would you choose embedded objects (such as `<object>` or `<embed>`) over native HTML media elements, and what limitations do they have today?
    
5. Describe how you would design a semantic media block using `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` that is SEO-friendly, accessible, and responsive across devices.
