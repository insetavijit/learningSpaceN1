Below is the **Next.js document**, written as a **nested list** and made **structurally isomorphic** to your **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Express, and Git** outlines.  
Same four sections, same nesting depth, same academic syllabus tone.

This **Next.js outline now aligns perfectly** with your curriculum set in:

- Structure
    
- Nesting depth
    
- Academic tone
    
- Foundational intent
    

If you want, the next natural additions are:

- **React (same nested structure)**
    
- **Node.js (aligned backend foundation)**
    
- **TypeScript (typed foundation layer)**
    

State the next one explicitly.
