> **Scope / Keywords:** `<<INSERT KEY CONCEPTS, UTILITIES, FEATURES, OR SUBTOPICS>>`
> 
> Follow these strict rules:
> 
> ### **Structure**
> 
> - Divide the output into **three levels**:
>     
>     1. **Beginner Level — 3 Questions**
>         
>     2. **Advanced Level — 4 Questions**
>         
>     3. **Professional / Interview Level — 5 Questions**
>         
> 
> ### **Beginner Level Guidelines**
> 
> - Focus on **definitions, purpose, and basic usage**
>     
> - Questions should test whether the candidate understands _what it is_ and _why it exists_
>     
> - Avoid implementation details
>     
> 
> ### **Advanced Level Guidelines**
> 
> - Focus on **behavior, comparisons, internal mechanics, and correct usage**
>     
> - Include “how”, “why”, and “what happens if” style questions
>     
> - Introduce trade-offs and common mistakes
>     
> 
> ### **Professional / Interview Level Guidelines**
> 
> - Focus on **real-world decision making, architecture, audits, scalability, accessibility, performance, or maintainability**
>     
> - Questions should simulate **senior-level interviews**
>     
> - Include refactoring, misuse detection, and evaluation scenarios
>     
> 
> ### **Style Rules**
> 
> - Do **NOT** include answers
>     
> - Use **clear, neutral, interview-appropriate language**
>     
> - Questions must progress logically from simple → complex
>     
> - Avoid vague or generic wording
>     
> - Assume the reader is preparing for **serious interviews**, not casual learning
>     
> 
> ### **Output Format**
> 
> - Use markdown headings exactly as follows:
>     
>     - `## Beginner Level — 3 Questions`
>         
>     - `## Advanced Level — 4 Questions`
>         
>     - `## Professional / Interview Level — 5 Questions`
