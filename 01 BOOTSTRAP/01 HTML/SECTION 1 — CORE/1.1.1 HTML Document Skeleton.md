### **Objective**

Build a precise mental and practical model of the mandatory structural elements that define a valid HTML document and establish standards mode, metadata scope, and global document context.

### **Approach**

Treat the document skeleton as both a **browser contract (how the page must begin)** and a **global configuration layer** that influences parsing, rendering, accessibility, and URL resolution.

### **Method**

- Start with the role of `<!DOCTYPE html>` and observe how it triggers standards mode.
    
- Define the `<html>` root element and apply global attributes such as `lang` for language context.
    
- Populate the `<head>` with essential metadata:  
    character encoding, viewport, title, and resource links.
    
- Set document character encoding early using `<meta charset="utf-8">` to prevent parsing errors.
    
- Declare the document language using `lang` to support accessibility and text processing.
    
- Use `<base>` to understand how base URLs affect relative link and resource resolution.
    
- Separate metadata (`<head>`) from rendered content (`<body>`) and observe browser behavior.
    
- Inspect how browsers recover when parts of the skeleton are missing or misordered.
    

### **Constraints**

- Always include `<!DOCTYPE html>` as the first line.
    
- Declare character encoding before any text content.
    
- Use exactly one `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` element.
    
- Avoid placing visible content inside `<head>`.
    
- Use `<base>` cautiously, as it globally affects all relative URLs.
    
- Do not omit `lang`; it is essential for accessibility and internationalization.

| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **DOCTYPE declaration**            | Declares the document as HTML5 and instructs the browser to use standards mode, preventing legacy quirks and ensuring consistent rendering behavior.                        |
| **`<html>` root element**          | The top-level container that wraps the entire document and establishes the global context for language, direction, and document-wide attributes.                            |
| **`<head>` metadata container**    | Holds non-visual information such as metadata, title, character encoding, styles, scripts, and resource hints that influence how the document is processed and interpreted. |
| **`<body>` content container**     | Contains all visible and interactive content rendered to the user, forming the primary interface layer of the webpage.                                                      |
| **Character encoding (`charset`)** | Defines how text bytes are interpreted into characters (typically UTF-8), ensuring correct display of multilingual content and symbol sets.                                 |
| **Language declaration (`lang`)**  | Specifies the primary natural language of the document, enabling proper pronunciation, translation, and accessibility behavior in assistive technologies.                   |
| **Base URL handling (`<base>`)**   | Sets a base reference for resolving relative URLs, affecting link targets, resource loading, and navigation consistency across the document.                                |

## **Advanced Level — 4 Questions**

1. How does the presence or absence of a correct `<!DOCTYPE>` affect browser rendering behavior?
    
2. What is the purpose of declaring character encoding using `<meta charset="utf-8">`, and what problems occur if it is missing or incorrect?
    
3. Why is the `lang` attribute on the `<html>` element important for accessibility and SEO?
    
4. What is the `<base>` element, and how does it influence URL resolution in a document?
    

## **Professional / Interview Level — 5 Questions**

1. Walk through how a browser interprets an HTML document skeleton from the first byte to standards-mode rendering.
    
2. In a multilingual, SEO-sensitive website, how would you correctly configure language, encoding, and metadata at the document level?
    
3. What real-world bugs can arise from incorrect `<base>` usage, and how would you detect and fix them in a production codebase?
    
4. How does improper placement of metadata (scripts, styles, meta tags) inside the document skeleton affect performance and parsing?
    
5. As part of a technical audit, what checks would you perform to ensure every page follows a correct and future-proof HTML document structure?
