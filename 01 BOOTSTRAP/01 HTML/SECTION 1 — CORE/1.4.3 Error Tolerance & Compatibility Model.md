Boss, here is **[[1.4.3 Error Tolerance & Compatibility Model]]** in the **same structure**, concise and quality-focused.

---

## **[[1.4.3 Error Tolerance & Compatibility Model]]**

### **Objective**

Build a precise mental and practical model of how browsers tolerate malformed HTML, preserve backward compatibility, and switch rendering behavior based on document mode.

### **Approach**

Treat compatibility as both a **robustness contract (accept broken input)** and a **historical constraint (support legacy content)**. Study it from the dual perspective of **spec-defined error handling** and **real-world rendering modes**.

### **Method**

- Experiment with **malformed markup handling** to observe how browsers auto-correct missing or misnested tags.
    
- Study the parser’s **error recovery mechanisms** and how they normalize invalid structures into a valid DOM.
    
- Trace **backward compatibility guarantees** that ensure old pages continue to work in modern browsers.
    
- Compare documents with and without `<!DOCTYPE html>` to observe **standards mode vs quirks mode** behavior.
    
- Inspect layout, box model, and CSS differences between modes using simple test cases.
    
- Use DevTools to confirm the active document mode.
    
- Review common legacy patterns that still influence modern behavior.
    
- Validate markup to identify errors that browsers silently repair.
    

### **Constraints**

- Never rely on malformed markup to achieve desired layouts or behavior.
    
- Always declare `<!DOCTYPE html>` to ensure standards mode.
    
- Avoid coding to quirks mode or legacy browser behavior.
    
- Do not assume different browsers recover from errors identically.
    
- Treat browser tolerance as a safety net, not a development strategy.
    
- Prefer validation and correctness over relying on compatibility hacks.

Boss, here is the **topic → brief description table** for **[[1.4.3 Error Tolerance & Compatibility Model]]**, consistent with your established structure and internals-focused tone.

|**Topic**|**Brief Description**|
|---|---|
|**Malformed markup handling**|The browser’s error-tolerant parsing strategy that interprets and repairs invalid or incomplete HTML, allowing pages to render consistently despite syntax mistakes.|
|**Backward compatibility guarantees**|The commitment of modern browsers to preserve behavior for legacy web content, ensuring that older pages continue to function even as standards evolve.|
|**Standards mode vs quirks mode**|The rendering modes that determine whether a document follows modern HTML/CSS specifications or emulates legacy browser behaviors, typically triggered by the presence or absence of a valid DOCTYPE.|

Certainly, Boss. Below is the **HTML technical interview question set** for:

> **[[1.4.3 Error Tolerance & Compatibility Model]]**  
> Malformed markup handling, backward compatibility, and standards vs. quirks mode.

Structured for **Beginner → Advanced → Professional (Interview)** rounds.

---

## **Beginner Level — 3 Questions**

1. What does it mean that HTML is an _error-tolerant_ language?
    
2. What is malformed HTML? Give a simple example.
    
3. What is quirks mode in a browser?
    

---

## **Advanced Level — 4 Questions**

1. How do browsers typically handle missing or mis-nested tags in HTML?
    
2. What are backward compatibility guarantees in HTML, and why are they important for the web?
    
3. What triggers standards mode versus quirks mode in modern browsers?
    
4. How does the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration influence parsing and rendering?
    

---

## **Professional / Interview Level — 5 Questions**

1. Describe how the HTML parsing algorithm’s error recovery rules affect real-world markup and cross-browser consistency.
    
2. In a legacy project that depends on quirks mode, how would you plan a migration to standards mode without breaking layouts?
    
3. What are practical risks of relying on browser error tolerance instead of writing valid HTML?
    
4. How do backward compatibility requirements shape the evolution of the HTML standard compared to other languages?
    
5. How would you debug subtle layout or scripting bugs that appear only because a page is being rendered in quirks mode?
