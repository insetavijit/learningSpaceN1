**1. PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor)**  
A widely used server-side scripting language for web development, enabling dynamic content generation, database interaction, and seamless embedding within HTML-based applications.

**2. Server-Side Scripting Language**  
A programming language executed on the web server to generate dynamic responses, process user input, and deliver computed content to clients over HTTP.

**3. General-Purpose Programming Language**  
A language designed for solving a broad range of computational problems, supporting diverse paradigms and application domains beyond a single specialized purpose.

**4. Interpreted Language**  
A language whose source code is executed by an interpreter at runtime rather than compiled into standalone machine code beforehand.

**5. Dynamic Typing**  
A type system where variable types are determined at runtime, allowing flexible assignments without explicit type declarations by the programmer.

**6. Weak Typing**  
A typing discipline that permits implicit type conversions between different data types, sometimes sacrificing strict type safety for convenience and flexibility.

**7. Imperative Programming**  
A paradigm that expresses computation as sequences of commands that change program state through assignments, control flow, and explicit instructions.

**8. Object-Oriented Programming**  
A paradigm organizing software around objects that encapsulate data and behavior, supporting concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

**9. Procedural Programming**  
A paradigm that structures programs as procedures or functions operating on data, emphasizing step-by-step execution and modular decomposition.

**10. Server-Side Execution**  
The execution of application logic on the server environment before sending processed output, typically HTML or JSON, to the client.

**11. Request–Response Model**  
A communication pattern where clients send requests to servers, which process them and return corresponding responses over network protocols like HTTP.

**12. Embedded Scripting**  
The practice of inserting executable script code directly within markup or host documents to enable dynamic content generation during rendering.

**13. PHP Runtime Engine**  
The execution environment responsible for parsing, interpreting, and running PHP scripts, managing memory, variables, and interaction with extensions.

**14. Zend Engine**  
The core open-source runtime engine of PHP that performs lexical analysis, compilation to opcodes, and execution of PHP scripts efficiently.

**15. Execution Context**  
The runtime environment defining variable scope, function state, configuration, and resources available during the execution of a script.

**16. Superglobals**  
Predefined global arrays in PHP that provide access to request data, server information, session state, and environment variables across all scopes.

**17. $_GET**  
A superglobal array containing URL query parameters sent via HTTP GET requests, commonly used for retrieving idempotent client input.

**18. $_POST**  
A superglobal array holding form data transmitted through HTTP POST requests, typically used for submitting sensitive or large payloads.

**19. $_REQUEST**  
A superglobal array that aggregates input from $_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE, providing a unified interface to request variables.

**20. $_SESSION**  
A superglobal array used to persist user-specific data across multiple requests by maintaining state on the server through session identifiers.

**21. $_COOKIE**  
A superglobal array representing client-side cookies sent with HTTP requests, enabling lightweight state management and user preference storage.

**22. $_SERVER**  
A superglobal array exposing server and execution environment information, including headers, paths, request methods, and configuration details.

**23. Stateless Execution Model**  
A model where each request is processed independently without inherent memory of previous interactions, requiring external mechanisms to maintain state.

**24. File-Based Scripts**  
An execution model where application logic is organized into individual script files that are interpreted and executed per request by the server.

**25. Standard Library**  
A collection of core APIs and utilities bundled with the language, providing essential functions for strings, arrays, files, networking, and system tasks.

**26. Built-in Functions**  
Predefined functions provided by the language runtime that perform common operations without requiring external libraries or user-defined implementations.

**27. Extensions**  
Modular packages that extend PHP’s core functionality by adding native capabilities such as database drivers, cryptography, or image processing.

**28. Composer**  
The dependency manager for PHP that automates package installation, version resolution, and autoload generation for managing external libraries.

**29. Dependency Management**  
The process of declaring, resolving, and maintaining external libraries required by a project to ensure consistent and reproducible builds.

**30. Namespaces**  
A language feature that organizes code into logical scopes to avoid name collisions and improve modularity in large applications.

**31. Autoloading (PSR-4)**  
A standardized mechanism for automatically loading class files based on namespace-to-directory mappings, eliminating manual include statements.

**32. Error Handling**  
Mechanisms for detecting, reporting, and managing runtime errors to ensure controlled program behavior and facilitate debugging.

**33. Exceptions**  
Structured runtime error objects that alter normal control flow, allowing programs to handle exceptional conditions through try–catch constructs.

**34. Output Buffering**  
A technique that captures script output in memory before sending it to the client, enabling modification, compression, or delayed transmission.

**35. PHP-FPM**  
PHP FastCGI Process Manager, a high-performance process manager that handles PHP execution efficiently for web servers using the FastCGI protocol.

**36. Web Server Integration (Apache / Nginx)**  
The mechanism by which PHP is executed through web servers using modules or FastCGI interfaces to process requests and deliver dynamic responses.
