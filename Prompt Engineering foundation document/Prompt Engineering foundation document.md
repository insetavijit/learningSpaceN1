Below is the **Prompt Engineering foundation document**, written as a **nested list** and designed to be **structurally isomorphic** to your existing foundations (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, WordPress, databases, etc.).  
Same four sections, same nesting depth, same academic syllabus tone.
