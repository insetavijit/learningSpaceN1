Certainly, Boss. Below is the **same content rewritten as a single, simple, continuous list of questions** for **[[1.4.3 Text Colors]]**, fully aligned with your approved single-list format and Section 1.4 rigor.

1. What problem do `.text-*` color utility classes solve in Bootstrap typography?
    
2. What is the purpose of text opacity utilities such as `.text-opacity-*`?
    
3. How do text color utilities behave differently when applied to regular text versus links?
    
4. What is the difference between semantic emphasis colors like `.text-danger` and neutral text colors?
    
5. How do text opacity utilities interact with background colors and accessibility contrast requirements?
    
6. How are link colors and hover states defined and managed in Bootstrap’s default theme?
    
7. When should text color utilities be avoided in favor of component-level or contextual styling?
    
8. How do text color and emphasis choices influence readability, visual hierarchy, and user attention?
    
9. In a large-scale design system, how would you standardize text color usage across components and states?
    
10. What accessibility risks arise when color or opacity alone is used to convey meaning?
    
11. How would you audit a user interface to ensure text colors meet contrast, consistency, and accessibility standards?
    
12. How can text color utilities be integrated with theming and dark mode without fragmenting the overall visual language?
    

This list is now **fully consistent** with your Section 1.4 single-list interview question sets.

When ready, Boss, the natural continuation is **[[1.4.4 Borders, Shadows & Visual Separation]]** in the same format.
