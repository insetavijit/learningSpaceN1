Below is the **React foundation document**, written as a **nested list** and made **structurally isomorphic** to your **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Express, Git, Next.js, MongoDB, MySQL, Node.js, and PHP** outlines.  
Same four sections, same nesting depth, same academic foundation tone.

This **React outline now fully aligns** with your entire foundations set in:

- Structure
    
- Nesting depth
    
- Academic tone
    
- Curriculum intent
    

If you want the **TypeScript**, **WordPress**, or **Redis** foundation next in the _same exact structure_, state the subject only.
