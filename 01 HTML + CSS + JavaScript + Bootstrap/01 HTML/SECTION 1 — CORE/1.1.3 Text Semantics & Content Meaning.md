|Topic|Brief Description|
|---|---|
|**Headings (`h1`–`h6`)**|Define the hierarchical structure of content, creating a logical outline for both users and search engines.|
|**Paragraph vs `span` Semantics**|`p` represents a standalone block of text, while `span` is a generic inline wrapper with no inherent meaning.|
|**Emphasis (`strong`, `em`)**|Convey importance (`strong`) and stress (`em`) in text, adding semantic meaning beyond visual styling.|
|**Quotations (`blockquote`, `cite`)**|Mark up quoted content and its source to represent citations and referenced statements correctly.|
|**Lists (`ul`, `ol`, `dl`)**|Group related items as unordered, ordered, or term–description pairs for structured information.|
|**Inline Semantic Elements**|Inline tags like `code`, `abbr`, `time`, and `mark` that add specific meaning within text without breaking flow.|
