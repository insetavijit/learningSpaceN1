### **Objective**

Build a precise mental and practical model of how HTML sectioning elements define document structure, create meaningful hierarchy, and expose navigable landmarks to users and assistive technologies.

### **Approach**

Treat sectioning elements as both **content organizers (logical grouping)** and **semantic signals (outline and landmarks)**. Study them from the dual perspective of **document meaning** and **navigation affordances**.

### **Method**

- Identify the roles of `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<nav>`, `<aside>`, and `<footer>` within a page.
    
- Practice structuring content to reflect logical hierarchy rather than visual layout.
    
- Observe how sectioning elements contribute to the document outline and heading structure.
    
- Use `<nav>` and `<main>` to establish clear landmark regions.
    
- Group self-contained content with `<article>` and thematic groupings with `<section>`.
    
- Place complementary or tangential content inside `<aside>`.
    
- Inspect landmarks and outline in DevTools or screen reader tooling.
    
- Refactor non-semantic `<div>` layouts into meaningful sectioning elements.
    

### **Constraints**

- Do not use sectioning elements purely for styling purposes.
    
- Ensure headings follow a logical order within each section.
    
- Avoid multiple `<main>` elements per document.
    
- Use `<nav>` only for major navigation blocks.
    
- Do not confuse `<section>` with `<div>`; sections must have a thematic purpose.
    
- Avoid over-nesting sectioning elements without clear meaning.

|**Topic**|**Brief Description**|
|---|---|
|**`<header>`**|Represents introductory or navigational content for a section or page, typically containing headings, logos, or contextual controls.|
|**`<main>`**|Identifies the primary content of the document, excluding repeated elements like headers and footers, and serves as a key landmark for assistive technologies.|
|**`<section>`**|Defines a thematically grouped block of content with a logical heading, contributing to the document outline and structural hierarchy.|
|**`<article>`**|Encapsulates self-contained, independently distributable content such as blog posts, news items, or comments.|
|**`<nav>`**|Designates a section of navigation links, enabling user agents and assistive technologies to recognize and jump between navigational regions.|
|**`<aside>`**|Contains tangential or complementary content related to the main content, such as sidebars, callouts, or contextual information.|
|**`<footer>`**|Represents concluding content for a section or page, often containing metadata, legal information, or related links.|
|**Document outline & landmarks**|The combined effect of sectioning elements in forming a meaningful document structure that supports logical reading order, accessibility landmarks, and navigational shortcuts.|

## **Beginner Level — 3 Questions**

1. What are semantic HTML elements, and why are they preferred over generic `<div>` elements?
    
2. What is the purpose of the `<header>` and `<footer>` elements?
    
3. What role does the `<nav>` element play in a webpage?
## **Advanced Level — 4 Questions**

1. Explain the difference between `<section>` and `<article>`. When should each be used?
    
2. Why must there be only one `<main>` element per page, and what does it represent?
    
3. How does `<aside>` differ from `<section>` in terms of document meaning?
    
4. What is meant by the HTML document outline, and how do sectioning elements affect it?
## **Professional / Interview Level — 5 Questions**

1. Design a semantic page structure for a content-heavy site (e.g., news or documentation). Which elements would you use and why?
    
2. How do landmark elements improve navigation for screen reader users, and how would you verify this behavior?
    
3. What are common mistakes teams make when using sectioning elements, and how do these mistakes impact accessibility and SEO?
    
4. How would you refactor a legacy layout built entirely with `<div>`s into a semantically correct structure without breaking styles?
    
5. How does proper structural semantics contribute to long-term maintainability and collaboration in large codebases?
