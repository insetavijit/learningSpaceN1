Boss, here is **[[1.3.2 ARIA Integration Boundaries]]** in the **same structure**, concise and quality-focused.

## **[[1.3.2 ARIA Integration Boundaries]]**

### **Objective**

Build a precise mental and practical model of where and how ARIA should be applied in HTML, and where it must not be used, to enhance accessibility without breaking native semantics.

### **Approach**

Treat ARIA as a **semantic augmentation layer**, not a replacement for HTML. Study it from the dual perspective of **capability extension** and **risk of semantic distortion**.

### **Method**

- Identify cases of **allowed ARIA usage**, such as adding roles, states, and properties to non-semantic containers when no suitable native element exists.
    
- Study **forbidden ARIA usage**, including assigning roles that conflict with native semantics or applying ARIA to elements with strong implicit roles.
    
- Compare native elements with ARIA equivalents (e.g., `<button>` vs `role="button"`) to understand behavioral differences.
    
- Practice enhancing components with ARIA states like `aria-expanded`, `aria-pressed`, and `aria-hidden` when driven by JavaScript.
    
- Verify ARIA effects in the accessibility tree and screen reader output.
    
- Refactor examples to replace ARIA-heavy markup with simpler native HTML where possible.
    
- Review the ARIA in HTML specification to understand element–role restrictions.
    

### **Constraints**

- Always prefer native HTML elements over ARIA roles.
    
- Never use ARIA to change or override the inherent meaning of a native element.
    
- Do not add ARIA roles that duplicate existing implicit roles.
    
- Avoid applying ARIA where it provides no additional semantic value.
    
- Never rely on ARIA alone to provide keyboard interaction or focus management.
    
- Remove ARIA when it becomes incorrect or stale due to UI state changes.

Boss, here is the **topic → brief description table** for **[[1.3.2 ARIA Integration Boundaries]]**, consistent with your established structure and instructional tone.

|**Topic**|**Brief Description**|
|---|---|
|**Allowed ARIA usage**|Legitimate scenarios where ARIA attributes enhance accessibility, such as supplementing native semantics, labeling complex widgets, or conveying dynamic states not otherwise exposed.|
|**Forbidden ARIA usage**|Misuses of ARIA that conflict with native semantics (e.g., changing roles of standard elements or adding redundant roles), which can degrade accessibility and confuse assistive technologies.|
|**Native HTML vs ARIA**|The design principle that native HTML elements should be preferred for semantics and behavior, with ARIA used only when equivalent native solutions do not exist (“Use HTML first, ARIA second”).|

Certainly, Boss. Below is the **HTML technical interview question set** for:

> **[[1.3.2 ARIA Integration Boundaries]]**  
> Allowed ARIA usage, forbidden ARIA usage, and native HTML vs. ARIA semantics.

Structured for **Beginner → Advanced → Professional (Interview)** rounds.

---

## **Beginner Level — 3 Questions**

1. What is ARIA, and why is it used in web accessibility?
    
2. When would you add an ARIA attribute to an HTML element?
    
3. What does the phrase “**use native HTML first**” mean in the context of accessibility?
    

---

## **Advanced Level — 4 Questions**

1. Give examples of **allowed ARIA usage**, where ARIA enhances accessibility without changing native behavior.
    
2. What is **forbidden ARIA usage**? Provide examples where ARIA should not be applied to certain elements.
    
3. Why should you avoid adding roles like `role="button"` to a native `<button>` element?
    
4. Explain how incorrect ARIA can make a site less accessible rather than more accessible.
    

---

## **Professional / Interview Level — 5 Questions**

1. Describe a real-world scenario where ARIA is necessary because native HTML alone is insufficient. How would you implement it safely?
    
2. How would you audit an existing codebase to detect ARIA misuse and refactor it toward native semantics?
    
3. What are the risks of using ARIA to “fix” accessibility issues caused by poor HTML structure?
    
4. How do screen readers prioritize native semantics versus ARIA roles and properties when both are present?
    
5. As a lead developer, how would you enforce ARIA usage guidelines across a team to prevent accessibility regressions?
