## **Bootstrap Layout System — Section 1.2 Cheatsheet (Table)**

|**Area**|**Concept / Utility**|**What It Does**|**Key Rules / Notes**|**Common Mistakes**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Containers**|`.container`|Fixed, responsive max-width wrapper|Centers content, readable line length|Nesting containers unnecessarily|
||`.container-fluid`|Full-width wrapper|Edge-to-edge sections|Using for text-heavy content|
||Responsive containers|Change width at breakpoints|`.container-md` = fluid until `md`|Overcomplicating layouts|
|**Breakpoints**|`xs → xxl`|Viewport width thresholds|Mobile-first, min-width based|Designing for devices, not content|
||Mobile-first|Base styles apply to small screens|Larger screens override|Writing desktop-first CSS|
||No prefix (`.col-6`)|Applies to all sizes|Defines baseline behavior|Overusing breakpoint classes|
|**Grid Core**|`.row`|Grid context|Manages gutters & alignment|Placing rows outside containers|
||`.col-*`|Grid columns|Must be direct children of `.row`|Skipping rows|
||12-column system|Proportional layout|Highly divisible|Hardcoding widths everywhere|
|**Column Sizing**|`.col`|Auto-layout columns|Even width distribution|Expecting fixed sizes|
||`.col-6`, `.col-md-4`|Explicit sizing|Precise control|Over-specifying columns|
||Column wrapping|Total > 12 wraps|Automatic behavior|Forcing widths manually|
|**Gutters**|Gutters|Space between columns/rows|Column padding + row negative margins|Mixing with margins incorrectly|
||`.g-*`|Both axes spacing|Grid-level spacing|Using for component spacing|
||`.gx-*`, `.gy-*`|Axis-specific spacing|Fine control|Inconsistent gutter use|
||`.g-0`|No spacing|Image grids, edge layouts|Removing gutters everywhere|
|**Row Columns**|`.row-cols-*`|Column count per row|Equal-width columns|Using for hierarchical layouts|
||Responsive row-cols|Change count per breakpoint|Mobile-first|Overlapping with `.col-*`|
|**Nesting**|Grid nesting|Row inside column|Required structure|Rows inside rows|
||Nesting depth|Should be shallow|Each level needs purpose|Deep DOM trees|
||Nested gutters|Same logic, smaller impact|Tune per level|Double spacing|
|**Alignment**|`.align-items-*`|Align all items vertically|Cross axis|Applying to non-flex|
||`.align-self-*`|Align one item|Overrides container|Overusing overrides|
|**Distribution**|`.justify-content-*`|Horizontal distribution|Main axis spacing|Misunderstanding axis|
|**Centering**|Flex centering|Horizontal + vertical center|`d-flex + justify + align`|Using absolute positioning|

## **One-Line Mental Model (Exam Favorite)**

> **Container defines boundaries → Row defines alignment context → Column defines width → Gutters define rhythm → Utilities fine-tune behavior**
