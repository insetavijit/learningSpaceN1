Certainly, Boss. Below is the **same content rewritten as a single, simple, continuous list of questions** for **[[1.3.1 Headings & Display Typography]]**, fully aligned with your approved single-list format.

1. What is the purpose of Bootstrap’s heading utility classes (`.h1`–`.h6`)?
    
2. How do display headings (`.display-*`) differ from standard headings in intent and practical usage?
    
3. Why might a developer apply a heading utility class to a non-heading HTML element?
    
4. What is the difference between semantic HTML headings (`<h1>`–`<h6>`) and Bootstrap’s visual heading classes?
    
5. How do display headings influence visual hierarchy, and in which situations should they be avoided?
    
6. How can heading sizes and styles be customized globally using Bootstrap’s Sass variables or utility overrides?
    
7. How would you implement responsive heading sizing across breakpoints without breaking semantic structure?
    
8. How do heading and display typography decisions affect content hierarchy, readability, and accessibility?
    
9. In a large-scale design system, how would you standardize heading styles while preserving semantic correctness?
    
10. What accessibility risks arise when visual heading styles do not align with the document’s semantic outline?
    
11. How would you audit a page to verify that heading typography supports both SEO and assistive technologies?
    
12. How can responsive heading strategies be implemented without relying on excessive breakpoint-specific overrides?
