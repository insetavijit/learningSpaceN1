## **[[S01 CORE — Notion Fundamentals & Building Blocks]]**

In Notion interviews or practical assessments, you're not judged on how many block types you can name, but on how you architect information systems—choosing the right database structure, explaining why a specific view solves a workflow problem, justifying when to use relations vs. rollups, and showing that your workspace design supports team collaboration and scalability. Demonstrating this systems-thinking signals to interviewers that you understand knowledge management, not just tool features.
