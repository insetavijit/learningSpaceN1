Certainly, Boss. Below is the **single, simple, continuous list of questions** for:

> **[[1.4.5 Color Contrast & Accessibility]]**  
> WCAG AA/AAA compliance; contrast ratios; using `.text-bg-*` for automatic contrast; testing color accessibility.

1. What is color contrast, and why is it critical for accessibility in UI design?
    
2. What do WCAG AA and AAA contrast compliance levels represent?
    
3. How are contrast ratios calculated between text and background colors?
    
4. What minimum contrast ratios are required for normal text and large text under WCAG guidelines?
    
5. How does Bootstrap’s `.text-bg-*` utility help ensure sufficient color contrast automatically?
    
6. In what situations should `.text-bg-*` be preferred over manually pairing `.text-*` and `.bg-*` classes?
    
7. What accessibility risks arise when color contrast is insufficient, even if the UI looks visually appealing?
    
8. How does poor contrast affect users with low vision, color blindness, or situational impairments?
    
9. How would you test color contrast compliance during development and QA?
    
10. What tools or techniques can be used to audit contrast ratios in an existing interface?
    
11. How can contrast requirements be maintained consistently across themes, branding, and dark mode?
    
12. How would you balance brand color constraints with accessibility standards without compromising usability?
    

This list is now **fully aligned** with your Section 1.4 single-list interview question pattern.

When ready, Boss, the next natural continuation is **[[1.4.6 Spacing Utilities & Visual Rhythm]]** or consolidation of **Section 1.4** into a final interview-grade checklist.
