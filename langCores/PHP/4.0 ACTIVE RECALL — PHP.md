## **4.1 Flashcards (Q/A) — Rapid Memory Drills**

| Topic                                 | Brief Description (25–40 words)                                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **[[Syntax, Types & Operators]]**     | Quick retrieval of foundational elements that appear constantly in real code. Reinforces correctness and speed of reasoning. |
| **[[Superglobals & Sessions]]**       | Review request, environment, and session state management—core to PHP web applications.                                      |
| **[[Errors vs Exceptions]]**          | Clarifies program failure handling paths and structured exception hierarchies.                                               |
| **[[Common Functions & Constructs]]** | High-frequency tools (`isset`, `empty`, `array_map`, `json_encode`) essential in everyday backend workflows.                 |
