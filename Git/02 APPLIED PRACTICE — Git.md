This **Git outline now fully aligns** with your curriculum set:

- HTML
    
- CSS
    
- JavaScript
    
- Bootstrap
    
- Express
    

in **structure, nesting depth, tone, and academic intent**.

If you want next:

- **Node.js** in this exact structure
    
- **React** aligned to the same four sections
    
- A **full-stack unified syllabus (HTML → Git)**
