###### **Eleventy (11ty)** is a JavaScript-based static site generator that compiles content, data, and templates into static HTML files at build time, producing deployable websites without requiring a runtime server.

**What it is:**  A flexible, content-first build tool for generating clean, maintainable, and high-performance static websites. It supports multiple templating languages, integrates structured data through front matter and data files, and fits naturally into modern Jamstack workflows.

**What it is not:**  Not a client-side JavaScript framework, not a backend web server, not a full-stack application platform, and not a runtime rendering system; it does not manage databases, APIs, or application state.

**Summary (Easy Language):**  
Eleventy builds fast websites from simple files before you publish them, but it does not run apps or servers.
