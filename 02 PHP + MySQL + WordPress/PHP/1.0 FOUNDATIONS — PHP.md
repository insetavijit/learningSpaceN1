# **1.1 Definitions — What is PHP?**

**Section Overview (35–50 words):**  
PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a server-side scripting language designed to process HTTP requests and generate dynamic application responses. It executes inside a structured runtime environment, interacts with data systems, and outputs HTML, JSON, XML, or binary responses for clients.

|Term|Brief Description (15–25 words)|
|---|---|
|**PHP**|Backend scripting language used to build dynamic, data-driven applications that run on the server.|
|**Server-Side Execution**|Code is executed on the server (NGINX / Apache / Caddy + PHP-FPM), not on the client.|
|**Superglobals**|Built-in arrays providing request, environment, session, file, and cookie data.|
|**Script File**|`.php` entry file executed per request to process logic and return output.|
|**Extensions**|Modules extending PHP functionality (PDO, Redis, GD, cURL, intl).|

# **1.2 Core Principles**

**Section Overview (30–45 words):**  
Strong PHP engineering emphasizes structure, clarity, scalability, type safety, and security by default. These principles support maintainable applications, predictable behavior, and high performance across modern distributed architectures.

|Principle|Brief Description (15–25 words)|
|---|---|
|**Strict Typing**|Enforces predictable variable behavior and prevents hidden type conversions.|
|**Separation of Concerns**|Routing, logic, persistence, and presentation isolated into distinct layers.|
|**Readability & Maintainability**|Code optimized for humans first, without clever complexity.|
|**Security by Design**|All inputs sanitized and validated before processing.|
|**Scalable Layered Architecture**|Components designed to expand without restructuring core systems.|

---

# **1.3 Mental Models**

**Section Overview (25–50 words):**  
Conceptual frameworks that simplify reasoning about PHP request execution and runtime performance. These mental models assist architects and engineers in debugging, optimization, and system design.

|Model|Explanation (15–25 words)|
|---|---|
|**Request → Script → Response**|PHP handles one complete request cycle per execution.|
|**Share-Nothing Runtime**|Each request starts fresh with no retained state except external systems.|
|**Opcode Cached Engine**|Compiled bytecode reused for subsequent requests for faster performance.|
|**Value vs Reference Awareness**|Memory semantics influence performance and correctness.|

# **1.4 Architecture Overview**

**Section Overview (30–45 words):**  
This section explains how PHP operates within a modern web stack. It details how requests travel across infrastructure layers into the runtime environment, through application architecture, and out as structured responses.

## **1.4.1 High-Level Execution Flow — Engineering Tree View**

```
System Actor: User / Browser
Event: Initiates HTTP request (GET / POST / PUT / DELETE)

Request Path:
└── CDN / Reverse Proxy Layer
      • Handles caching, SSL termination, and traffic filtering
      • Provides rate-limiting, routing, DDoS protection, load balancing
      • Examples: Cloudflare, Fastly, Akamai
      ↓
└── Web Server Layer
      • NGINX / Apache / Caddy
      • Serves static assets (CSS, JS, images)
      • Applies rewrite/virtual host rules, decides request destination
      • Forwards dynamic requests to PHP via FastCGI
      ↓
└── PHP Runtime Layer
      • PHP-FPM worker pools manage concurrent request execution
      • Opcache reuses precompiled opcode blocks for faster startup
      • JIT compiler accelerates CPU-intensive processing paths
      ↓
└── Application Entry Point
      • public/index.php invoked per request
      • Composer autoloading (PSR-4) resolves classes on demand
      • Framework/bootstrap initializes configuration and middleware
      ↓
└── Routing & Dispatching
      • Identifies appropriate controller/handler based on URI + method
      • Normalizes input into structured Request objects (DTO/FormObject)
      ↓
└── Controller Layer
      • Validates and sanitizes request data
      • Delegates workflow execution to domain/service logic
      ↓
└── Service / Domain Logic
      • Performs business rules, calculations, transformations
      • Determines required state changes or queries
      ↓
└── Persistence & Integration Layer
      • Database access (MySQL / PostgreSQL / MariaDB)
      • Caching (Redis / Memcached)
      • External API calls (payment, authentication, AI, search)
      ↓
└── Response Construction
      • HTML rendering via Blade / Twig (template engines)
      • JSON encoding for API and SPA front-ends
      • File streams / binary output (downloads, images, PDFs)
      ↓
System Output: HTTP Response returned to Browser
      • Browser renders the view or consumes API data
      • UI updates, next interaction begins
```

### **Engineering Summary**

PHP operates as a deterministic request-processing engine inside a layered web stack. Input travels through infrastructure layers into PHP’s runtime, where structured application logic transforms it into a formatted response, returned to the client in real-time.

# **1.5 Internals & Mechanics**

|Mechanism|Explanation (15–25 words)|
|---|---|
|**Zend Engine**|Compiles PHP into opcodes and executes them.|
|**Opcache**|Stores precompiled opcode blocks in shared memory to avoid repeated compilation.|
|**JIT Execution**|Dynamically optimizes heavy workloads by converting opcodes into machine instructions.|
|**Memory & References**|Understanding ref-counting prevents slowdowns and leaks.|
|**Error Levels**|Categorizes recoverable and fatal errors, enabling structured handling.|

# **1.6 Limitations & Trade-offs**

|Limitation|Description (15–25 words)|
|---|---|
|**Legacy Weak Typing**|Requires strict typing and static analysis to ensure consistency.|
|**Inline Logic in Views**|Encourages clutter and reduces maintainability.|
|**Per-Request Startup Cost**|Mitigated by opcache, preloading, efficient workers.|
|**Large Legacy Footprint**|Requires disciplined refactoring strategies.|

### **FOUNDATIONS Summary — Systems Perspective**

PHP is a structured, request-driven execution environment designed for high-performance backend development. Understanding its runtime, architectural layers, and engineering principles is essential before advancing into modern frameworks and production-grade systems.
