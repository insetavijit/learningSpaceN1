### Questions -
###### Q1. What is the Bootstrap utility system and what is its main purpose?

=> The utility system is a collection of small, single-purpose classes that apply specific styles directly in HTML. The purpose is to enable quick styling without writing custom CSS. In practice, developers adjust spacing, colors, or display using utilities. The risk is overloading markup with too many classes, making it hard to read and maintain.

###### Q2. Why is Bootstrap described as utility-first in many layouts?

=> Utility-first means layouts are often built by combining small helper classes instead of custom styles. The purpose is speed and consistency. In practice, entire layouts are shaped using utilities alone. The risk is creating cluttered HTML if structure and intent are not kept clear.

###### Q3. What do display utilities like .d-none and .d-block control?

=> Display utilities change how elements are rendered or hidden. The purpose is to show, hide, or change layout behavior quickly. In practice, elements are hidden on mobile or shown as flex containers. The risk is hiding important content unintentionally.

###### Q4. When should .d-flex be used instead of .d-block?

=> .d-flex turns an element into a flex container, while .d-block makes it a normal block. The purpose is to enable flexible layouts. In practice, .d-flex is used to align items in a row. The risk is using flex when simple block layout would be clearer.

###### Q5. Why are responsive display utilities important?

=> Responsive display utilities change visibility across breakpoints. The purpose is to adapt layouts for different screens. In practice, menus hide on small screens and show on large ones. The risk is forgetting certain breakpoints, leaving gaps in the UI.

###### Q6. What are flexbox utilities in Bootstrap used for?

=> Flexbox utilities help control layout direction, wrapping, and alignment. The purpose is to build flexible and responsive layouts easily. In practice, developers align items center or distribute space. The risk is complex flex rules that become hard to debug.

###### Q7. How do justify-content and align-items differ in flex layouts?

=> Justify-content controls spacing along the main axis, while align-items controls the cross axis. The purpose is precise alignment. In practice, items are centered horizontally or vertically. The risk is mixing them up and getting unexpected alignment.

###### Q8. What problem do positioning utilities solve?

=> Positioning utilities set how elements are placed relative to the page or containers. The purpose is to control static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky behavior. In practice, headers are fixed or badges are absolutely placed. The risk is overlapping content if positions are misused.

###### Q9. When should fixed or sticky positioning be used cautiously?

=> Fixed and sticky elements stay visible while scrolling. The purpose is persistent access. In practice, navbars remain at the top. The risk is covering content or reducing usable screen space, especially on mobile.

###### Q10. What are offset utilities like .top-* and .start-* used for?

=> Offset utilities move positioned elements from edges. The purpose is fine placement control. In practice, icons are nudged into corners. The risk is relying on offsets instead of proper layout, leading to fragile designs.

###### Q11. Why is z-index control important in layered interfaces?

=> Z-index controls which elements appear on top. The purpose is correct stacking of overlays. In practice, modals sit above content. The risk is random stacking values that cause elements to disappear or overlap incorrectly.

###### Q12. What do border utilities provide in everyday layouts?

=> Border utilities add or remove borders and control rounding. The purpose is visual separation and emphasis. In practice, cards get outlines or rounded corners. The risk is cluttering the UI with too many borders.

###### Q13. How do rounded utilities affect visual design?

=> Rounded utilities soften corners of elements. The purpose is modern, friendly appearance. In practice, buttons and cards look less rigid. The risk is over-rounding everything, making layouts look inconsistent.

###### Q14. What is the role of shadow utilities in UI design?

=> Shadow utilities add depth to elements. The purpose is to suggest elevation and focus. In practice, modals and cards stand out. The risk is overusing shadows, which makes the interface feel heavy and distracting.

###### Q15. What do visibility and opacity utilities control?

=> These utilities control whether elements are visible and how transparent they are. The purpose is subtle show or hide effects. In practice, elements fade or become invisible. The risk is hiding content that should remain accessible.

###### Q16. How is .invisible different from .d-none?

=> .invisible hides an element visually but keeps its space, while .d-none removes it from layout. The purpose is layout control. In practice, placeholders keep spacing. The risk is choosing the wrong one and breaking layout flow.

###### Q17. What are overflow utilities used for?

=> Overflow utilities control how content behaves when it exceeds its container. The purpose is to allow scrolling or hide excess content. In practice, code blocks scroll horizontally. The risk is hiding important content without a way to access it.

###### Q18. Why are float utilities still relevant in Bootstrap?

=> Float utilities move elements left or right within text flow. The purpose is simple wrapping behavior. In practice, images float beside text. The risk is using floats for full layouts instead of modern flex or grid.

###### Q19. What do interaction helper utilities like .pe-none control?

=> Interaction helpers control user actions like pointer events or text selection. The purpose is to enable or block interaction. In practice, disabled overlays ignore clicks. The risk is blocking interaction accidentally and confusing users.

###### Q20. Why might cursor utilities be useful in interfaces?

=> Cursor utilities change the mouse cursor style. The purpose is to signal interactivity. In practice, pointers indicate clickable areas. The risk is misleading users by showing clickable cursors where no action exists.

###### Q21. What is the purpose of vertical alignment utilities?

=> Vertical alignment utilities align inline or table elements vertically. The purpose is tidy inline layouts. In practice, icons align with text. The risk is misalignment if used on elements they do not affect.

###### Q22. Why are responsive utility variants powerful in Bootstrap?

=> Responsive variants apply utilities only at certain breakpoints. The purpose is adaptive styling. In practice, spacing or display changes with screen size. The risk is complex class combinations that are hard to reason about.

###### Q23. What is a common mistake when relying heavily on utilities?

=> A common mistake is using utilities to patch poor structure. The purpose of avoiding this is clean markup. In practice, layout should be solved structurally first. The risk is messy HTML that is hard to refactor.

###### Q24. When should custom CSS be preferred over utilities?

=> Custom CSS is better for reusable or complex styles. The purpose is maintainability. In practice, components get their own classes. The risk is forcing utilities everywhere and duplicating long class lists.

###### Q25. How do utilities support rapid prototyping?

=> Utilities allow quick styling directly in markup. The purpose is speed in building layouts. In practice, prototypes take shape without CSS files. The risk is shipping prototype-style code into production.

###### Q26. What is the overall risk of misusing Bootstrap utilities?

=> Misuse leads to cluttered markup, inconsistent design, and maintenance problems. The purpose of disciplined use is clarity and speed. In practice, balanced use keeps code clean. The risk is technical debt and confusing layouts when utilities replace thoughtful design.
