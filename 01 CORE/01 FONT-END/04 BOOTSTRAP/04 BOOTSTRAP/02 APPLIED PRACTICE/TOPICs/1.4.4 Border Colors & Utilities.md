Certainly, Boss. Below is the **same content rewritten as a single, simple, continuous list of questions** for **[[1.4.4 Border Colors & Utilities]]**, fully aligned with your approved single-list format and Section 1.4 rigor.

1. What problem do border utility classes solve in Bootstrap layouts and components?
    
2. How do `.border-*` color utilities work, and where are they most commonly applied?
    
3. What is the purpose of border side utilities such as `.border-top`, `.border-end`, or `.border-start`?
    
4. How can border width and border style be controlled using Bootstrap utility classes?
    
5. How do border utilities interact with theme colors and background color utilities?
    
6. What is the difference between visually removing a border and structurally removing it using border utilities?
    
7. When should border utilities be avoided in favor of component-level or custom styling?
    
8. How do border color and usage choices affect visual separation, grouping, and affordance in UI layouts?
    
9. In a production interface, how would you standardize border usage to reduce visual noise and inconsistency?
    
10. What accessibility or usability issues can arise from overusing borders for emphasis or separation?
    
11. How would you audit a codebase to identify misuse of border utilities or conflicting border styles?
    
12. How can border utilities be integrated into a scalable design system without fragmenting visual hierarchy or design intent?
    

This list is now **fully consistent** with your Section 1.4 single-list interview question series.

When ready, Boss, the natural continuation is **[[1.4.5 Shadows & Elevation]]** in the same format.
