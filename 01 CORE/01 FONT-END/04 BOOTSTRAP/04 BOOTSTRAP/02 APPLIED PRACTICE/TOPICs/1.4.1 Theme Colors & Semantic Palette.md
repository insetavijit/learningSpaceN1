Certainly, Boss. Below is the **same content rewritten as a single, simple, continuous list of questions** for **[[1.4.1 Theme Colors & Semantic Palette]]**, fully aligned with your approved single-list format.

1. What are theme colors in Bootstrap, and why are they considered semantic rather than purely decorative?
    
2. What are the standard Bootstrap theme colors, and what general purpose does each serve?
    
3. Where are theme colors most commonly applied within Bootstrap components and utility classes?
    
4. How does Bootstrap’s semantic color system improve visual consistency and long-term maintainability across a UI?
    
5. What is the difference between using a theme color to convey meaning (for example, `.text-danger`) versus using color only for visual styling?
    
6. How can Bootstrap theme colors be customized or extended using Sass variables?
    
7. What risks arise when semantic colors are reused for inconsistent, misleading, or non-semantic purposes?
    
8. How do semantic color choices influence user perception, usability, and error recognition?
    
9. In a large-scale application, how would you define and enforce guidelines for appropriate use of each theme color?
    
10. What accessibility concerns must be addressed when color is used to communicate status or meaning?
    
11. How would you audit an interface to identify misuse of semantic colors or violations of design intent?
    
12. How can a semantic color palette be scaled to support branding, theming, and dark mode without losing clarity or meaning?
    

This list is now **fully consistent** with your earlier single-list interview question sets.

When ready, Boss, the natural continuation is **[[1.4.2 Color Utilities & Backgrounds]]** in the same format.
